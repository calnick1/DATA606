<b> Project Aim: </b>

A time of Global Pandemic, protests, and presidential changes, but mainly a time of uncertainty. No one knows how long it will take the world to develop a vaccine, and until then, our financial markets are going to be very unstable. As I write this, I realize that the past two weeks showed on of the fastest stock rebounds in history. Then today (6/11/2020), the Dow experienced the 27th largest 1-day decline in history after experiencing one the fastest stock rebounds in history. My goal is to find lucrative investment opportunities during this black swan event.

<b> Research Questions: </b>

1. What are the current market conditions? 

2. How has the Coronavirus impacted stock prices and why is investing now such a troubling time?  

3. There are many companies researching Coronavirus vaccines, could investing in these companies be the most prudent option?

4. We are in the middle of a textbook definition of a recession (two consecutive quarters of GDP decline).

5. Do certain stocks perform better following a recession?

6. Can machine learning be used to classify the outperforming stocks from the underpeforming stocks? If so, what are the characteristics that separate winners from losers?

<b> Graphs </b>

If time allots, visuals will be created through Tableau. However, most will start out as a python visual and may stay as a python visual if that seems to be best option.
