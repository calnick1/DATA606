<b> Project Aim: </b>

A time of Global Pandemic, protests, and presidential changes, but mainly a time of uncertainty. No one knows how long it will take the world to develop a vaccine, and until then, our financial markets are going to be very unstable. As I write this, I realize that the past two weeks showed on of the fastest stock rebounds in history. Then today (6/11/2020), the Dow experienced the 27th largest 1-day decline in history after experiencing one the fastest stock rebounds in history. My goal is to find lucrative investment opportunities during this black swan event.

<b> Research Questions: </b>

What are the current market conditions? How has the Coronavirus impacted stock prices and why is investing now such a troubling time?  
There are many companies researching Coronavirus vaccines, could investing in these companies be the most prudent option?
We are in the middle of a textbook definition of a recession (two consecutive quarters of GDP decline). Do certain stocks perform better following a recession?
Can machine learning be used to classify the outperforming stocks from the underpeforming stocks? If so, what are the characteristics that separate winners from losers?

If time allots, visuals will be created through Tableau. However, most will start out as a python visual and may stay as a python visual if that seems to be best option.
